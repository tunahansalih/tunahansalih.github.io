I am also a Computer Engineering MSc student at [Bogazici University](https://www.boun.edu.tr) [Computer Engineering Department](https://cmpe.boun.edu.tr/), currently working on Few-Shot Learning, Conditional Networks and Curriculum Learning, under the supervision of Prof. Lale Akarun. We also founded [BURST](https://www.instagram.com/burstbogazici) as Bogazici University students in order to build electric autonomous prototype vehicles and compete in national and international competitions. I have been the captain of perception team for 2+ years.

I'm mostly using Python, especially with tensorflow, numpy and pandas. Other than python, I have also experience with C++, C#, C and Java.
