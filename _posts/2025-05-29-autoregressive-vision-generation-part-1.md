## Generating Pixels One by One: Your First Autoregressive Image Generation Model

Welcome, I am glad you are here!

I'm [Tuna](https://tunahansalih.github.io). My world is pretty much all about image and video generation. It is what I focus on in my PhD and during my internships at places like Adobe (working on Firefly!) and Amazon AGI. For a while, I have been working with diffusion-based models, they are incredibly powerful.

But the landscape of generative modeling is always growing, and I want to explore other types of generative models. Right now, I am diving into autoregressive models. I always find the best way to learn a topic is by trying to teach it to others. So, this blog post series is an attempt to teach myself the basics of autoregressive models, hoping you can learn something from it, too. I'll start with the basics and try to understand how these models work piece by piece.

So, if you are curious about this side of the generative AI, let's get started and see how to generate images pixel by pixel!

## What Makes a Model "Autoregressive"?

Alright, "Autoregressive". Let's break it down with some mathematical intuition!

You have already seen "auto-regressive" models in action even if you didn't call them that. At its heart, it basically means predicting the next outcome based on all the things that came before it.

Think about how you type on your phone. When you write "the weather is ...", the keyboard will suggest completions based on the words you entered such as "sunny", "rainy", "perfect for AI research" (maybe not that last one). That's an auto-regressive model in action for language!

**Mathematically**, for a sequence \(x_1, x_2, ..., x_T\), an autoregressive model learns:

\[
P(x_1, x_2, ..., x_T) = P(x_1) \cdot P(x_2|x_1) \cdot P(x_3|x_1, x_2) \cdot ... \cdot P(x_T|x_1, ..., x_{T-1})
\]

This is just the **chain rule of probability**! Each new element depends on all the previous ones.

For images, we can think of each pixel as an element in our sequence. So instead of predicting the next word, we're predicting the next pixel value based on all the pixels we've seen so far. Cool, right?

## Let's Start with Data: Meet Our MNIST Friends

Before we dive into the math, let's get acquainted with our data. We'll use MNIST digits - they're simple, well-understood, and good for learning the basics.

```python
import random
import torch
import torchvision
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load and visualize some MNIST data
mnist = torchvision.datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=torchvision.transforms.ToTensor())


rand_indices = random.sample(range(len(mnist.data)), 100)
images = mnist.data[rand_indices]

print(f"Image batch shape: {images.shape}")
print(f"Individual image shape: {images[0].shape}")
print(f"Pixel value range: [{images.min():.3f}, {images.max():.3f}]")

# Create a nice grid to visualize
grid = torchvision.utils.make_grid(images, nrow=10)

plt.figure(figsize=(15, 15))
plt.imshow(grid.permute(1, 2, 0))
plt.axis('off')
plt.title("Sample MNIST Digits - Our Raw Material!")
plt.show()
```

## The "Pixel as Token" Approach: Quantizing Intensities

In this advanced version, we treat image generation more like language modeling. Each pixel's intensity will be **quantized** into one of a discrete number of bins. Each bin then gets an integer label, effectively turning our pixels into "tokens" or "words" from a fixed vocabulary.

**1. Quantization:**

- We take the continuous grayscale pixel values (0.0 to 1.0).
- We divide this range into `K` discrete bins (e.g., `K=16` or `K=256`).
- Each pixel's original intensity is mapped to the integer label of the bin it falls into.
- Example: If `K=4`, intensities 0.0-0.25 map to token 0, 0.25-0.5 to token 1, etc.

**2. Prediction as Classification:**

- The model's task is now to predict the **integer label** (token) of the next pixel, given the tokens of previous pixels.
- This is a **K-class classification problem** for each pixel.

**Benefits:**

- Allows using powerful classification machinery (like Cross-Entropy loss).
- Can be combined with techniques like embedding layers for tokens, similar to NLP.

**Trade-offs:**

- **Information Loss:** Quantization inherently loses some precision from the original grayscale values. More bins reduce this loss but increase model complexity.
- **Vocabulary Size:** The number of bins (`K`) becomes our vocabulary size.

```

## The Heart of Autoregression: Context Windows

Now for the fun part! How do we actually implement "predicting the next pixel based on previous pixels"?

The key insight is **context windows**. Instead of using ALL previous pixels (which would be computationally expensive and might not even help), we use a **sliding window** of the last `k` pixels as our context.

**Mathematically**, instead of modeling \(P(x_i | x_1, x_2, ..., x_{i-1})\), we approximate it as:

$$P(x_i | x_{i-k}, x_{i-k+1}, ..., x_{i-1})$$

This is called a **k-th order Markov assumption** - we assume the immediate past is most informative for predicting the future.

**But wait!** What about the first few pixels that don't have enough history? That's where our **start tokens** come in - they're like saying "this is the beginning of an image" to our model.

## Building Our Neural Network: Predicting Pixel Tokens

Our neural network will now predict a **distribution over the possible pixel tokens (integer labels)** for the next pixel.

**Architecture changes for categorical prediction:**

1. **Embedding Layer (Input):**
    - Instead of feeding raw integer token values, we'll use an `nn.Embedding` layer.
    - This layer learns a dense vector representation for each possible pixel token (0 to K-1) and for our special `START_TOKEN_VALUE_INT`.
    - Input to the model will be sequences of these integer tokens.
2. **Hidden Layers:** Same as before (fully connected layers with ReLU and Dropout).
3. **Output Layer:**
    - The final layer will have `NUM_QUANTIZATION_BINS` output units (one for each possible pixel token).
    - These are **raw logits** (no softmax applied here, as `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` handles it internally).

The model learns to map a context of previous pixel *token embeddings* to a score for each possible *next* pixel token.

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Reminder of our settings:
# NUM_QUANTIZATION_BINS = (K)
# START_TOKEN_VALUE_INT = (special token index)

## Preparing Training Data: Contexts and Target Tokens

The `create_randomized_training_data` function will now generate context windows consisting of **integer pixel tokens** and a target **integer pixel token**.

- **Context**: A sequence of `CONTEXT_LENGTH` integer tokens. These can be actual pixel tokens (0 to K-1) or the special `START_TOKEN_VALUE_INT`.
- **Target**: A single integer token (0 to K-1) representing the actual next pixel value.

The overall logic of creating all pairs and shuffling remains, but it operates on integer token sequences.

## Training: Learning to Predict Pixel Tokens with Cross-Entropy Loss

With our "pixel as token" approach, training involves predicting the correct integer label for the next pixel from `K` possibilities. This is a multi-class classification problem.

We will use **Cross-Entropy Loss** (`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`).

**Cross-Entropy Loss expects:**

1. **Model Output (Logits):** Raw, unnormalized scores for each of the `K` classes (pixel tokens). Shape: `[batch_size, NUM_QUANTIZATION_BINS]`.
2. **Target Labels:** Integer class indices representing the true pixel token. Shape: `[batch_size]`, with values from `0` to `NUM_QUANTIZATION_BINS - 1`.

The loss function internally applies a Softmax to the logits and then calculates the negative log likelihood of the true class.

$$\text{Logits} = \text{Model}(\text{context tokens})$$
$$\mathcal{L}_{CE} = - \log \left( \frac{\exp(\text{logit}_{\text{true_token}})}{\sum_{j=0}^{K-1} \exp(\text{logit}_j)} \right)$$

This encourages the model to assign a high score (logit) to the correct next pixel token.

print("🎉 Token-based training completed!")
```

## Generation: Autoregressively Predicting Pixel Tokens

Now we generate images by autoregressively predicting pixel tokens.

**Generation Process (Pixel as Token):**

1. Initialize context: A sequence of `CONTEXT_LENGTH` special `START_TOKEN_VALUE_INT` tokens.
2. Feed context to the `CategoricalPixelPredictor` model to get logits for the next pixel token (scores for each of the `K` bins).
3. Apply **Softmax** to these logits to get a probability distribution over the `K` possible pixel tokens.
4. **Sample** an integer token (0 to K-1) from this probability distribution.
5. This sampled integer token is our generated pixel for the current position.
6. Update context: Append the new token and remove the oldest.
7. Repeat for all pixels.
8. For visualization, **de-quantize** the sequence of generated integer tokens back to approximate grayscale image.

```python
import numpy as np

## What Have We Accomplished? (Pixel-as-Token Version) 🎉

Congratulations! You've now built and trained an autoregressive image model using a **"pixel as token"** approach. This is a more advanced technique that aligns closely with how modern sequence models (like Transformers) often handle complex data.

### Key Concepts Covered in this Version

1. **Pixel Quantization**: Converting continuous grayscale pixel values into a discrete set of integer tokens (our "pixel vocabulary").
2. **Categorical Prediction**: Treating next-pixel prediction as a K-class classification problem, where K is the number of quantization bins.
3. **Embedding Layer**: Learning dense vector representations for each pixel token, including a special start token.
4. **Cross-Entropy Loss**: Using the appropriate loss function for multi-class classification to train the model based on token logits.
5. **Autoregressive Token Sampling**: Generating images by sequentially:
    a.  Predicting logits for the next pixel token.
    b.  Converting logits to probabilities (via Softmax).
    c.  Sampling an integer token from this distribution.
    d.  Using the sampled token as context for the next step.
6. **De-quantization for Visualization**: Converting the generated sequence of integer tokens back into a viewable grayscale image.

### Mathematical Foundation

The model learns to predict the probability of the next pixel token \(x_i\) given the context of previous tokens \(C_i\):

$$P(x_i = \text{token}_j | C_i) = \text{Softmax}(\text{Logits}_j)$$

Where Logits are the output of our `CategoricalPixelPredictor`.
The training minimizes the Cross-Entropy loss based on these predicted probabilities and the true next token.

### Why this approach is powerful

- It directly leverages the well-established framework of sequence modeling with discrete vocabularies, common in NLP.
- It allows for potentially more complex categorical distributions to be learned for each pixel.
- It forms a conceptual bridge to models like VQ-VAEs and Image Transformers which use discrete latent codes or pixel tokens.

### Potential Next Steps & Experiments

1. **Number of Quantization Bins (`NUM_QUANTIZATION_BINS`):**
    - Try increasing K (e.g., to 32, 64, 128, or even 256 for full 8-bit representation). How does this affect image quality, training time, and model complexity? More bins mean less information loss but a harder classification task.
2. **Embedding Dimension (`EMBEDDING_DIM`):** Experiment with different sizes. Too small might underfit; too large might overfit or be slow.
3. **Model Architecture:** Explore deeper or wider networks. Could a different architecture (e.g., small convolutional context encoder, or even a recurrent layer) improve performance?
4. **Sampling Temperature:** Experiment with different `temperature` values during generation. Lower temperatures (<1.0) make generation more greedy and less random; higher temperatures (>1.0) increase randomness.
5. **Learning Rate and Epochs:** This token-based model might require more careful tuning of LR and more epochs to converge well, especially with larger K.
6. **Conditional Generation:** Could we condition this model on class labels to generate specific digits?

This "pixel as token" method is a significant step towards more sophisticated generative modeling techniques. You've built a solid foundation!

Keep experimenting, keep learning, and enjoy generating images token by token! 🎨✨
