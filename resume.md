## RESEARCH STATEMENT
Advancing the generative AI through innovative approaches to generative models, with a focus on motion transfer in video generation, interpretability, and personalization techniques. My research aims to develop more controllable, interpretable, and efficient generative models that can bridge the gap between user intent and model output while maintaining high fidelity.
