## Work Experience

`Nov 2022 - Aug 2023`
__Machine Learning Engineer__, Lyrebird Studio
- Architected machine learning CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and build architecture as code using AWS CDK, enabling outputs of the research team to be quickly deployed as a service.
- Created golden AMIs for GPU-accelerated instances using Packer, dramatically reducing the boot-up time from tens of minutes to a few seconds and allowing for faster scale-up to handle high volumes.
- Designed and deployed image generation services based on stable diffusion to the production environment, handling thousands of requests per day on GPU-accelerated instances.
- Integrating deep learning-based generative solutions to existing applications, enhancing the capabilities of applications.

`Aug 2021 - Nov 2022`
__Machine Learning Engineer__, Vispera
- Automated deep learning model training with Python and TypeScript, accelerating model training and boosting the number of models deployed daily by ten times.
- Launched a VueJS front-end service for the operations department to train and deploy new models by monitoring online and offline metrics, enhancing model observability and researchers' productivity.
- Coordinated the deep learning stack transition to TensorFlow 2, making it faster and easier to adopt state-of-the-art deep learning models for production.

`Oct 2019 - Aug 2021`
__Computer Vision Research Engineer__, Vispera
- Led research and development for deep learning image recognition models using Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV, developing solutions for out-of-distribution recognition and hierarchical classification.
- Implemented state-of-the-art deep learning image recognition models achieving above 95\% classification accuracy on online measurements. 
- Formulated and implemented a novel zero-shot learning-based image recognition model using PyTorch, reducing image annotation time by four times by recommending the best matches without annotated data.

`Aug 2018 - Oct 2019`
__Computer Vision Research Engineer__, İdea Technology Solutions
- Introduced a novel tree-based deep learning architecture and method based on sparse execution of neural networks using Python, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow Lite for a project funded by The National Scientific and Technological Research Institution.
- Proposed a k-centroids-based clustering algorithm to determine better anchor boxes for object detection models, increasing the model's object detection performance by approximately 15%.
